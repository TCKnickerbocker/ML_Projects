# Kernel Perceptron on OptDigits Dataset
### This project implements the Kernel Perceptron algorithm to classify the OptDigits dataset. The Kernel Perceptron is a machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. It can classify data points into one of two classes based on a training dataset.

## Code
The core of this project is the kernPercGD function, which performs the Kernel Perceptron classification using gradient descent. in main.py, it is tested on randomly generated data, then with SVC, and finally with optdigits, being plot each time for data visualization.

## Usage
To use this code, you'll need to provide the training data, training labels, and the polynomial degree for the kernel function. The kernPercGD function will return the alpha values and bias term (b) after training.
