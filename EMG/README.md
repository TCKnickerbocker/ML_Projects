# Image Enhancement using EM-G Algorithm
This project demonstrates the use of the Expectation-Maximization Gaussian Mixture Model (EM-G) algorithm to enhance the clarity of images. Specifically, the project focuses on improving the quality of PNG images of stadiums and Goldy Gopher.

## Introduction
Image enhancement is a crucial step in computer vision and image processing. The EM-G algorithm is a powerful tool for image enhancement tasks. It's known to produce better results as the number of Gaussian components (k) increases.

## Usage
### To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Get some images you'd like to use, in my case, they are images of TCF bank stadium and goldy gopher

2. Set the desired value of k: You can experiment with different values of k to see how it affects the image enhancement results. Higher values of k tend to produce clearer images but require more computational resources.

3. Run the EMG function: Utilize the EMG function provided in the code to perform image enhancement. The function will take your input images and the chosen k value as parameters.

4. Analyze the results: The enhanced images will be produced as output. You can compare the results with the original images to observe the improvements achieved by the EM-G algorithm.

## Results
You'll observe that increasing the value of k tends to produce clearer and more visually appealing images. However, it may also require more computational resources and time.
