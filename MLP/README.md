# Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Project
<hr>

## Overview
This project contains code for creating, training, and testing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network on the Optdigits dataset.  

### Composition:
The project can be thought of in three separate parts:
#### - **The data folder**, which is interchangable with any other data the user wishes to utilize for MLP prediction
#### - **Numpy Folder**, which contains an MLP implementation using numpy ALONE
#### - **The Keras Folder** which contains keras implementations testing different layer structures and parameters on prediction outcomes, and will log the results using keras' TensorBoard functionality

## Dataset
The Optdigits dataset consists of 8x8 pixel images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is represented as an 8x8 matrix of pixel values, and the goal is to classify which digit the image represents.

## Dataset Source
You can obtain the Optdigits dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Dependencies
- Python (>=3.6)
- NumPy
- Keras
- Matplotlib
